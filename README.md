## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring Bitcoin trading signals and market data. The dashboard takes into account the Mayer Multiple as well as the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index. It also includes functionality to send trading signals to a Telegram bot.

### Mayer Multiple

The Mayer Multiple is a ratio that compares the current price of Bitcoin to its 200-day moving average. It is used to identify potential buying or selling opportunities based on historical trends. A Mayer Multiple above 2.4 indicates that Bitcoin is potentially overbought, while a value below 0.8 suggests it might be oversold. In this dashboard, lines are drawn for buy and sell signals based on other thresholds.

### Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index

The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is a sentiment analysis tool that aggregates various data sources to gauge the overall market sentiment towards Bitcoin. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with lower values indicating fear and higher values indicating greed. This metric helps to understand the emotional state of the market.

## Features

- Display Bitcoin trading signals.
- Show historical market data.
- Fear and Greed Index integration.
- Mayer Multiple analysis.
- Send daily updates to Telegram.
